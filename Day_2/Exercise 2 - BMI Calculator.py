Instructions:
Write a program that calculates the Body Mass Index (BMI) from a user's weight and height.

The BMI is a measure of some's weight taking into account their height. e.g. If a tall person and a short person both weigh the same amount, the short person is usually more overweight.

The BMI is calculated by dividing a person's weight (in kg) by the square of their height (in m):
BMI = WEIGHT / (HEIGHT**2)

Example Input
weight = 80
height = 1.75

Example Output
80 รท (1.75 x 1.75) = 26.122448979591837

weight = int(input('Weight: '))
height = float(input('Height: '))

bmi = weight / (height ** 2)
